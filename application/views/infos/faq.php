            <p><strong>1. Will I get the exact stone and ribbon combination from the picture?</strong></p>
            <p>Unless you are ordering a one of kind, you might not get the exact stone and ribbon you see in the picture. All of our gems are one of a kind and will have slight variances. Our ribbon is hand-dyed and might also slightly differ.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Do you have any tips for putting on a Faith Wrap?</strong></p>
            <p>As you wear your wrap, you will find your own favorite method to show off your wrap. Until then, you can borrow mine: Place the gem about 1 1/2" above your wrist. Take the ribbon pair closest to you and tightly wrap your wrist twice in front of the gem, keeping both ribbons as flat as possible. Then take the ribbon pair furthest away from you, and wrap your wrist twice behind the gem. Tie the ribbon in a double knot and let the ribbon hang for some added style. You can also tie the ribbon in a bow and tuck it under for a more conservative look.</p>
            <p><strong>3. How do I care for my wrap?</strong></p>
            <p>Silk is a natural protein fiber. Hand wash for a few minutes using lukewarm water and mild, non-alkaline soap such as Woolite. Do not use chlorine bleach. Optional, add a few drops of hair conditioner to the end of wash for an extra silky feel. Roll in towel to extract water. Hang to dry. Do not put in direct sunlight. Lightly steam or iron with a cool "silk" setting.</p>
            <p><strong>4. What is your return policy?</strong></p>
            <p>If for any reason you are dissatisfied with your wrap, we offer a 30 day exchange for a wrap of equal value. The buyer is responsible for return shipping</p>
