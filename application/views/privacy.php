            <p>Your collected information, such as product data and addresses, are stored in our secure databases and only used internally.

            <p><strong>2. E-mail Address</strong></p>
            <p>Your e-mail address is used as your login username. We use e-mail addresses as a way to communicate receipts, upcoming sales and new products. We will never sell or redistribute your e-mail address to a third party.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Secure Shopping</strong></p>
            <p>Orders placed via FaithWraps.com are submitted using a secure encrypted technology known as SSL.

This is the safest way to keep your most important personal data protected. If you would like to know more about this technology and how it protects you contact TechSupport@FaithWraps.com.</p>
